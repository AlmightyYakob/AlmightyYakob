### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jake

I'm an R&D Engineer [@Kitware](https://github.com/Kitware), where I work on exciting open source projects. I focus on creating scalable web applications that aim to solve problems in a wide range of areas such as [Neuroscience](https://github.com/dandi), [Geoscience](https://github.com/ResonantGeoData/ResonantGeoData), [Data Analysis](https://github.com/multinet-app), [Image Anotation/Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858615/), and more!
